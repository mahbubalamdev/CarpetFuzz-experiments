        "Note that this is the entire link-layer packet, so for link layers that pad (e Ethernet), the padding bytes will also be printed when the higher layer packet is shorter than the required padding.",
        "In the current implementation this flag may have the same effect as -xx if the packet is truncated.",
        "When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet, including its link level header, in hex.",
        "When parsing and printing, in addition to printing the headers of each packet, print the data of each packet (minus its link level header) in hex and ASCII.",

        "Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make tcpdump run postrotate-command file where file is the savefile being closed after each rotation.",
        "For example, specifying -z gzip or -z bzip2 will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.",
        "Note that tcpdump will run the command in parallel to the capture, using the lowest priority so that this doesnt disturb the capture process.",
        "And in case you would like to use a command that itself takes flags or different arguments, you can always write a shell script that will take the savefile name as the only argument, make the flags & arguments arrangements and execute the command that you want.",
        "If tcpdump is running as root, after opening the capture device or input savefile, but before opening any savefiles for output, change the user ID to user and the group ID to the primary group of user .",

        "The expression argument can be passed to tcpdump as either a single Shell argument, or as multiple Shell arguments, whichever is more convenient.",
        "Generally, if the expression contains Shell metacharacters, such as backslashes used to escape protocol names, it is easier to pass it as a single, quoted argument rather than to escape the Shell metacharacters.",
        "Multiple arguments are concatenated with spaces before being parsed."
